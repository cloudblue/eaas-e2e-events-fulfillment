# Welcome to Fulfillment automation testing !


The idea is to test multiple cases and monitor if the extensions are working well.

This extension will be used to approve PRs generated by the Hub extension, the one that will be
in charge to start the test periodically and check that everything goes fine.

In order to make this work we need to have:
* Two accounts (Vendor and Distributor) linked by contract.
* A Hub (Distributor)
* A forked Product (Vendor) with all capabilites without parameters and listed to the Distributor and with the proper connections created (to the Hub).
